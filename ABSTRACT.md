The **MFVT** dataset is a groundbreaking resource designed to rectify the limitations of existing datasets in the realm of Real-time Masked Facial Detection. Comprising 13,507 meticulously annotated images, it integrates authors' unique mask-wearing conventions to classify individuals into three distinct categories: *ok*, *none*, and *wrong*, offering a comprehensive and invaluable tool for advancing the field.

Although there have been a number of Masked Facial Detection datasets published, they all have their own limitations, from having different mask-wearing conventions to careless labelling and classes imbalanced. Therefore, a new dataset to overcome those problems, with correct, clear conventions on wearing masks and carefully annotated for research purposes is very essential. That motivates authors to build the MFVT dataset.

The MFVT dataset built from two datasets [PWMFD](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/7/837) and [FMLD](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/5/2070), along with some images collected from the Internet.

The reason authors chose those two datasets is that their images have been carefully selected by the authors from previous datasets such as [MAFA](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Ge_Detecting_Masked_Faces_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf) and [Wider Face](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Yang_WIDER_FACE_A_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). However, the mask-wearing conventions of those two datasets were different and they also differed from authors', so they re-annotated the entire dataset.

Authors follow [WHO’s advice](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) on how to wear masks and the [types of masks that can be worn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esM_ePHn0aw) during the COVID-19 epidemic to annotate the MFVT dataset. All the faces, or objects, in authors' dataset belong to one of three classes: properly wearing (ok), incorrectly wearing (wrong) and not wearing mask (none). Details on these classes are given below:

- Class ok: Firstly, about the type of mask that can be worn, authors consider cases that not only be medical masks but also can be something like fabric masks, scarves, buffs, or hijabs. Authors will call them “masks”. According to WHO’s advice, authors should wear a mask that could cover nose, mouth and chin. Therefore, if a person uses masks with “proper thickness” and wears them in that way, authors will annotate them as OK. For image data, they consider a mask with proper thickness when they can not see the part of the face occluded by that mask.

<span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">Example images for class ok. (a) - (d) Faces with medical masks. (e) - (f) Using scarves to cover nose, mouth and chin. (g) - (j) Wearing fabric masks properly. (k) - (l) Illustrations for hijabs.</span>

- Class wrong: Authors regard that a presented mask that does not cover the nose, mouth, and chin is the wrong way to wear a face mask. In addition, a mask worn without being pulled high enough is marked as an improperly wearing way (also, in a perspective, these cases are difficult for models to learn because it is easy to confuse between wrong and ok). Especially, masks with small holes (such as wool masks) or wearing the mask on one side do not provide good protection for health during the pandemic, so authors also consider these as incorrect.

<span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">Example images for class wrong. (a) - (c) Not intending to use masks to protect from the virus. (d) - (f) The nose, mouth or chin is not covered. (g) - (h) The masks are not pulled high enough. (i) - (j) Small holes on wool masks. (k) - (l) The masks are worn just in one side.</span>

- Class none: In the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing too thin masks (such as mesh face veils, or satin face veils) or using hands, arms to cover the face are quite useless in preventing the virus from spreading. Therefore, these cases will be considered as not wearing masks. Authors also suppose that people using a mask to conceal the face but not wearing it on, or using kinds of stuff such as phones, papers, cups, books, placards, etc. to hide their face are not acceptable and will be annotated as none. Specially, when people use a scarf but do not intend to pull it up to cover the face (the scarf does not hide the mouth), authors assume that they do not intend to use it as a way to protect from viruses. Furthermore, authors attempt to consider the scene that people fake the face mask by pulling up a collar to cover the face. These cases are deemed as not wearing masks.

The PWMFD dataset focuses a lot on medical masks so authors also collect many images related to medical masks from this dataset. In addition, some other cases such as fabric masks or scarves in this dataset are also considered and selected. From 6340 training images and 1633 test images of the PWMFD dataset, authors have selected 2473 images and 500 images to use for the training set and test set of MFVT dataset, respectively. About the FMLD dataset, this dataset has a lot of images for different cases. Although there are many images of class NONE in FMLD derived from the [Wider Face dataset](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Yang_WIDER_FACE_A_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf), authors consider that those images do not really bring too much meaning to the Masked Facial Detection problem, so authors only select a few from them for the MFVT dataset. The cases that authors mentioned in mask conventions all have related images in the FMLD dataset (but they are annotated differently from authors' conventions). This is really a reliable source of images for us. From 34784 training images of the FMLD dataset, authors selected 6182 images and from 7152 test images, authors selected 850 images for the MFVT dataset. Notice that, in the process of selecting images from the two datasets above, authors may encounter images that are present in both datasets. A rather special case is that an image in the training set of one dataset is present in the testing set of the other dataset. Authors have thoroughly checked this detail and removed such images. From having two training set selected from two datasets PWMFD and FMLD, authors randomly select a small part from each set to get two validation sets, then merge them to get the overall validation set for the MFVT dataset. The training and testing set of authors' dataset are also merged from two selected sets correspondingly. Furthermore, authors also add background images (or images without objects) to the training set to make the models trained on the MFVT dataset more robust. In addition, a few other images for unusual cases are added to both the training and testing sets. Authors will call them Extra images.
